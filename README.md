# High School Personal Web development Project.🏫
🚀 My First Web Dev Project with Flask

This is my very first personal project in web development — built from scratch to learn the ropes of Python, HTML, CSS, and how everything connects on the web 🌐.

I used Flask as the backend framework, with a modular structure, clean route-based navigation, and handled user input using Flask Forms 📬.

This project helped me understand how back-end logic and front-end design come together to build functional web apps. It’s where I started to understand full-stack development 🛠️✨

💡 "Learn by building" was the motto — and it worked!
